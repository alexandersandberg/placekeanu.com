<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/placekeanu?utm_source=badge-featured&utm_medium=badge&utm_souce=badge-placekeanu" target="_blank"><img src="https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/featured.svg?post_id=160684&theme=dark" alt="PlaceKeanu - For when you need a little more Keanu in your life | Product Hunt Embed" style="width: 250px; height: 54px;" width="250px" height="54px" /></a>

## How to use this *lifechanging* service
Simply paste a link in this format, wherever you need him:

`https://placekeanu.com/[width]/[height]*/[options]*`<br>
(* optional)

If you don't specify a height, you'll get a **square** Keanu...<br>
...shape-wise, that is, because Keanu is always mindblowingly awesome.

## Available [options]
* Young Keanus only: `y`
* Grayscale: `g`

*Note: Some Keanus are grayscale by default.*

## Some examples
* Any Keanu: [https://placekeanu.com/200/150](https://placekeanu.com/200/150)
* Young Keanu: [https://placekeanu.com/500/300/y](https://placekeanu.com/500/300/y)
* Square + Grayscale: [https://placekeanu.com/250/g](https://placekeanu.com/250/g)
* Young + Grayscale: [https://placekeanu.com/300/550/yg](https://placekeanu.com/300/550/yg)

If you, for instance, need a little more Keanu in your website projects, you can include him with an \<img\>:

## How does it work?
When you send a valid request to this website, a random photo of [Keanu Reeves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keanu_Reeves) is displayed.

The photos are cached on your end for 1 day, which is why you don't get a new Keanu on every page load.

While some placeholder image websites dynamically create new images, this service is SVG-based. For this to work properly, all photos have been encoded to Base64.
